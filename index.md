I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in [Dr. John Tuthill's lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/tuthill/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Washington, where I anticipate completing my degree in Fall 2025. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 2018 (Go Slugs!). After completing my undergraduate studies with [Dr. James Ackman](https://ackmanlab.com/about.html/){:target="_blank"}, I worked as a Research Specialist in [Dr. Ishmail Abdus-Saboor's laboratory](https://www.abdus-saboorlab.com/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Pennsylvania for two years. During this time, I [developed new, ](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57258){:target="_blank"}[more objective assays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719309076){:target="_blank"}, and [computational tools](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk2425){:target="_blank"} to assess acute and chronic pain states in rodent models.

As a graduate student, my research aims to develop strategies to delineate neuronal pathways downstream of Drosophila nociceptors that drive aversive escape behaviors. I employ a combination of optogenetic activation, precise genetic silencing techniques, single-cell RNA sequencing, and neural electron microscopy [circuit reconstruction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07389-x){:target="_blank"} to gain a comprehensive understanding of these pathways.
