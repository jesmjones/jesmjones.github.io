Currently, I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in [Dr. John Tuthill's lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/tuthill/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Washington, and plan to graduate Fall 2025. I am a 2018 UC Santa Cruz alum (go slugs). For two years following my undergraduate career, I worked as a research specialist at the University of Pennsylvania in [Dr. Ishmail Abdus-Saboor's Lab](https://www.abdus-saboorlab.com/){:target="_blank"}. I [developed new, ](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57258){:target="_blank"}[more objective assays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719309076){:target="_blank"}, and [computational tools](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk2425){:target="_blank"} to assess acute and chronic pain states in rodent models.

Now, in my graduate career, I hope to develop a strategy to delineate neuronal pathways downstream of Drosophila nociceptors that govern aspects of aversive escape behaviors via optogenetic activation experiments, precise genetic silencing techniques, and [comprehensive neural EM circuit reconstruction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07389-x){:target="_blank"}
