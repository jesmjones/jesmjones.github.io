description: Agent-based Model for Nociception in Fruit Flies (Python)
---

Repo [here](https://github.com/jesmjones/ABM_nociceptive_congregation){:target="_blank"}.

This project attempts to create a basic framework for an agent-based model simulating nociception in fruit flies. This code sets up a basic simulation that switches from a random to a biased walk of flies within a circular arena
Our motivation for pursuing this project lies in the phenomenon that happens when activating nociceptors in the fruit fly: congregation. I noticed that when artificially activating these neurons via optogenetics, flies would avoid regions of optogenetic stimulation. However, flies would escape to regions where the flie population were denser. This prompted us to ask whether this was motivated by probability or chance, or whether that was intentional behavior.
